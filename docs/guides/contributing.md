```
Hidden behind a small village temple, this ancient stone carving 
depicts scenes from Buddhist Jataka tales dating back to the 12th 
century. The intricate artwork remains remarkably preserved, 
protected by the natural rock overhang above. Local monks are 
happy to explain the stories depicted in the carvings. Best 
visited in the early morning when the light illuminates the 
details beautifully. Take the village road past the main temple 
and follow the path for about 200 meters through the forest.
